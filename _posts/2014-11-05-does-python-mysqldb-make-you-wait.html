  content: I try to switch everything from MySQLdb to mysql-connector-python as that
    supports python3 and supports more of the newer features in MySQL.

<p>Recently while writing a data loading application for a customer, we've come into a problematic situation with the Python MySQLdb module that can be installed with base RHEL repository or DVD. As a little background, this application uses an HA architecture where a Virtual IP can be assigned to different servers during a failover scenario. However, during failover, as long as the VIPs are not re-assigned, the application could hang waiting for query response. A quick strace reveals something like:</p>
<pre class="brush: shell; gutter: false; first-line: 1">sendto(5, "W\0\0\0\3SELECT * FROM dataloader.bo"..., 91, 0, NULL, 0) = 91<br />
recvfrom(5,<&#47;pre><br />
Further test reveals that this problem will not timeout until after about 15 minutes which matches the default tcp_retries2 value on the system (see man 7 tcp):</p>
<pre class="brush: shell; gutter: false; first-line: 1">[root@node1 ~]# cat &#47;proc&#47;sys&#47;net&#47;ipv4&#47;tcp_retries2<br />
15<&#47;pre><br />
It turns out that this version of MySQLdb module has client net read and write timeouts set to 0 allowing the TCP setting to kick in instead at the maximum of ~15mins. Another problem, the same version does not support setting the timeout values, you'd have to upgrade to >= 1.2.4 to get this support within your MySQLdb.connect calls.</p>
<p>So, I see a few things we can do here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set default read and write timeouts to the module. I've opened an issue on GitHub via https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;farcepest&#47;MySQLdb1&#47;issues&#47;86 as this is only 2 lines change on the code. Hopefully this makes next release!<&#47;li>
<li>Of course, if you do decide to use the current release, make sure to set read_timeout and write_timeout values appropriate to your application!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
