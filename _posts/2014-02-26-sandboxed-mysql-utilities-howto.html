  content: Thanks for this HowTo! Didn't find anything like this on how to setup the
    generic-distribution of the utilities. Not even on dev.mysql.com or in the readme.

<p>Often I would need to work on customer servers where MySQL Utilities would be a really good fit for the tools I need. However, I would not want to mess around with the customer servers just to have it running so I would have the tools built and sandboxed on its own directory where I can cleanup later. Here's how:</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; gutter: true; first-line: 1">cd ~<br />
wget http:&#47;&#47;mysql.mirrors.hoobly.com&#47;Downloads&#47;MySQLGUITools&#47;mysql-utilities-1.4.1.tar.gz<br />
tar xzf mysql-utilities-1.4.1.tar.gz<br />
cd mysql-utilities-1.4.1<br />
python setup.py build<br />
python setup.py install --root=&#47;home&#47;revin&#47;mysql-utilities-1.4.1<br />
export PYTHONPATH=.:&#47;home&#47;revin&#47;mysql-utilities-1.4.1&#47;usr&#47;lib&#47;python2.6&#47;site-packages<br />
&#47;home&#47;revin&#47;mysql-utilities-1.4.1&#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;mysqlfrm --help<&#47;pre><br />
Your source of the package and install directory may vary - enjoy!</p>
