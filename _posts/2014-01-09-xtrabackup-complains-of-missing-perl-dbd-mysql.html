<p>I was busy testing a PXC cluster today when suddenly was buffled with a confusing error:</p>
<pre class="brush: shell; gutter: false; first-line: 1">140108 23:33:39 innobackupex: Connecting to MySQL server with DSN &#039;dbi:mysql:;mysql_read_default_group=xtrabackup&#039; (using password: NO).<br />
innobackupex: Error: Failed to connect to MySQL server as DBD::mysql module is not installed at &#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;innobackupex line 2913.<&#47;pre><br />
OK, so my first though was DBD::mysql is missing, but as I checked:</p>
<pre class="brush: shell; gutter: false; first-line: 1">[root@pxc03 keepalived]# yum list installed| grep perl-DBD-MySQL<br />
perl-DBD-MySQL.x86_64 4.013-3.el6 @base<&#47;pre><br />
After some digging, it's not actually the module that is missing - it was one of the module's dependency which is the mysql client library.</p>
<pre class="brush: shell; gutter: false; first-line: 1">[root@pxc03 keepalived]# yum deplist perl-DBD-MySQL.x86_64|grep mysql<br />
dependency: libmysqlclient.so.16()(64bit)<br />
provider: mysql-libs.x86_64 5.1.71-1.el6<br />
dependency: libmysqlclient.so.16(libmysqlclient_16)(64bit)<br />
provider: mysql-libs.x86_64 5.1.71-1.el6<&#47;pre><br />
I recently botched the shared-compat package on this instance while rotating packages with "--nodeps" hence, missing it silently :-D. After reinstalling, everything was again fine. I hope nobody else have to lose hair on this one.</p>
